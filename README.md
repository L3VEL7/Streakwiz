## Usage

1. After adding the bot to your server:
   - Use `/setup` to configure trigger words (admin only)
   - Use `/setstreak_limit` to configure how often users can update their streaks (admin only)
     - Options: hourly, daily, or none (unlimited)
     - Important: Set this after configuring trigger words
   - Users can start building streaks by sending messages that exactly match the trigger words
   - Use `/leaderboard` to view rankings for each trigger word
   - The bot will react with ðŸ”¥ to confirm streak increments

2. Example Setup:
   ```
   /setup words:daily,workout,study
   /setstreak_limit interval:daily
